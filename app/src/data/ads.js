It's been very easy for them to borrow money, and they're in over their heads, and it's all over then. Buffett is right. Banks own most major corporations, especially medical and education, and they raise prices to force people into debt. Then they set up interest rates, such that people have to keep paying their installments forever. That's why guys like me get a starting salary of $300,000 per year, not including bonuses. But what Buffett doesn't mention in this clip is that these rules don't apply to the rich, because they can exploit a loophole to legally get out of debt without declaring bankruptcy. Even Mr. 45, if you know who I'm talking about, used it back in the day to get out of $1.2 billion worth of debt without paying a single cent. And regular people can use this loophole too. They just hide it from you. That's why I quit banking, because I was sick of seeing how we are ruining people's lives. with this rigged system. So I figured out how I can get filthy rich by helping regular people. So far we've helped over 105,314 regular people last time I checked, to exploit this loophole and delete between $10,000 and $150,000 worth of debt each, allowing them to start fresh and finally put to rest that constant worry about what would happen to them and their families if they don't manage to make their next payment. This led to the media and banks referring to me as the Financial Robin Hood. If you want me and my team to help you exploit this loophole, then click the learn more button below this video and answer a few simple questions to see if we can help you. The only catch is we're a small team so we can only help a limited number of people exploit this loophole. And the spots are filling up fast. So click the learn more button below and delete your debt before your next installment is due.",
